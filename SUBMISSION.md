# Submission checklist

Choose your city on the [global event page](https://aitinkerers.org/hackathons/global/agents-everywhere). Use that city's participant portal for the submission deadline and published judging criteria, and its handbook for eligibility and required deliverables. See [hackathon-rules.md](hackathon-rules.md) for the agent-readable summary.

## Build eligibility

- [ ] Our submitted project is a net-new build created during the official hackathon period
- [ ] Its core functionality was built during the event; we are not resubmitting or extending a pre-existing project and entering it as new
- [ ] We identify inherited templates, libraries, prompts, components, and starter code separately from our event work

**What we inherited**
This repository's CopilotKit Channels starter, its managed gateway test fixture,
the shared surface rules, and the original incident example remain inherited
infrastructure. The incident components and tests are retained as reference
coverage but are not registered by the Wire Desk channel.

**What we built during the hackathon**
Wire Desk turns a content-planning Slack thread into a master brief and
platform-specific editions. The registered cards live in
`apps/channel/src/components.tsx`; explicit format choices are persisted by
`apps/channel/src/store.ts` and queried through the two Wire Desk tools in
`apps/channel/src/tools.tsx`. A card click records a local decision only; it
does not publish or send content.

## Title and description

**What you built**
<!-- Explain the complete interaction your demo shows. -->

**Who it is for**
<!-- Name a person in a concrete situation. -->

**Why the context matters**
<!-- What did the agent know or do because it lived in this surface? -->

**Sponsor technologies used**
<!-- Name the tools you actually used and the visible contribution of each. -->

## Evidence for the judging criteria

Judges score each of the four official criteria from 1–5. This checklist helps you gather evidence; it does not guarantee a score. A working starter is a foundation for your own project.

| Official criterion | Show in your project and demo |
|---|---|
| Core Requirements & Functionality | Run one complete workflow in the intended environment, from user request through tools to a verified result. Repeat it with live integrations; offline tests alone do not prove the deployed flow. |
| Innovation & Theme Alignment | Show the surrounding context before the prompt and explain the original interaction it enables. Compare with the context removed: what value would a standalone chatbox lose? |
| Technical Execution & Integration | Show how tools, data, and the environment connect. Demonstrate a relevant failure or cancellation path and explain recovery, state persistence, and integration limits. |
| Usefulness & Agentic Experience | Identify the user and problem, show a meaningful action in the surface, and demonstrate clear feedback and appropriate user control. Explain what work the agent saves. |

- [ ] We can point to visible evidence for every criterion
- [ ] We distinguish live services, sample data, session-only state, and standalone recipes
- [ ] Sponsor technologies contribute to the workflow; their count is not a judging criterion

## Public repository

- [ ] A new participant can run the quickstart from a clean clone
- [ ] The README lists the credentials and separate processes required
- [ ] `npm run verify` passes; optional recipe checks pass if used
- [ ] `.env`, tokens, generated traces with sensitive data, and account secrets are excluded
- [ ] Sample data, session-only state, and unimplemented integrations are clearly labeled

## Two-minute demo video

- [ ] Show the surface and existing context before the prompt
- [ ] Demonstrate one complete interaction
- [ ] Show a visible result: an actual record, local state change, or research source links
- [ ] If showing an approval, distinguish the decision from execution and demonstrate the resulting behavior
- [ ] State which sponsor technologies made the interaction possible
- [ ] Keep the video within the event's limit and check audio

See [demo prompts](dev-docs/demo-prompts.md) for the inherited incident workflow
and the Wire Desk content workflow. Live credentials and final video evidence
must still be supplied by the team before submission.

## Social post and final submission

- [ ] Follow the organizer's posting and sponsor-tagging instructions
- [ ] Link the public repository and video
- [ ] Credit the sponsors you used and applicable local partners
- [ ] Check the live integration once more before recording or submitting
- [ ] Inspect the repository, video and screenshots for secrets

Prepare the post and submission for a human to publish; running the starter kit
does not publish either automatically.
